### TO RUN:
	- Both the root directory, and client and server subdirectories have their own package.jsons. All aforementioned directories/subdirectories are under the effect of .gitignore, which ignores all node_modules subdirectories. 
	- Because of .gitignore, you must first install all dependencies by running command prompt and typing 'npm install' in both the root, client, and server directories.
	- Type 'npm start' to run both the client and server on ports 3000 and 3001 respectively.
